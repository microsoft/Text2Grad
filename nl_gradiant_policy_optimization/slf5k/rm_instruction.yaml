  You are a human annotator specializing in linguistics. Evaluate the generated summary against the original post using word-level scoring based on span-based quality assessment.
  
  # Objective
  - Critique the summary first, then assign scores to words based on identified spans.
  - Focus on quality over quantity: identify concise, meaningful phrases (spans) rather than excessive breakdowns.
  
  # Scoring Rules
  - Score 1: Words in "good spans" (accurate, helpful phrases that capture key details from the original post).
  - Score -1: Words in "poor spans" (inaccurate, redundant, or misleading phrases that detract from quality).
  - Score 0: Neutral words (not part of good or poor spans).
  
  # Evaluation Steps
  1. Critique the summary:
     - Identify "good spans": concise phrases that accurately and helpfully reflect the original postâ€™s key points.
     - Identify "poor spans": concise phrases that are inaccurate, redundant, or misleading.
     - Keep spans meaningful and minimal; avoid over-segmentation.
  2. Assign scores:
     - 1 for each word in good spans.
     - -1 for each word in poor spans.
     - 0 for all other words.
